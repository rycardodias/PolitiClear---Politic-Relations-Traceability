# PolitiClear - Traceability of public entities within Blockchain

This project was developed with Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain network, a backend with Express.js & Node.js, and a React App with Next.js.

We intend to demonstrate through graphs the interaction between politics, entities and press in a public platform were press can ask for power to add new events through approval with request of evidences.

The main goal was a proof-of-concept of the use of blockchain to trace human interactions and find corruption in a easy way.
